# Frontal-103
Frontal-103, A large-scale vehicle image dataset for fine-grained vehicle categorization.

# Overview

The Frontal-103 dataset is presented in our T-ITS paper (which is still under review): Lei Lu, Ping Wang, Hua Huang. **A Large-Scale Frontal Vehicle Image Dataset for Fine-Grained Vehicle Categorization.**

Fine-grained vehicle categorization has evolved into a significant subject of study due to its importance in the Intelligent Transportation System. A highly accurate and real-time vehicle categorization system will help to support many applications not only in the security aspect but also many walks of life. Facing the growing importance of this study, we present an image dataset named Frontal-103 to promote the development of the vision-based research on the vehicle, and
particularly for the task of fine-grained vehicle categorization. 

Here, we give a detailed introduction to the current state of frontal-103 dataset: 1,759 fine-grained vehicle models in 103 vehicle makes and 65,433 web-nature images in total. Apart from the specific viewpoint and vehicle hierarchy, Frontal-103 is superior to the other state-of-the-art vehicle image datasets not only in
the scale and diversity but also the accuracy and fine-grained level. We hope Frontal-103 will be beneficial to the vision-based vehicle analysis and contribute to the computer vision community.
